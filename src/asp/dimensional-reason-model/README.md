# Horty's dimensional reason model

This is an implementation of Horty's dimensional reason model in answer set programming.
There are two files making up the implementation:

1. `example-case-base.lp`: This file contains an example case base you can supply and explains all input configurations.
2. `model.lp`: This file contains all the inference rules and constraints required for the reason model. It allows checking the consistency of new cases as well as solving new ones.
