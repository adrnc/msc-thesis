You are an AI assistant whose job is to generate a “case base” of past bedtime‑decisions by parents
(the defendants) about whether children (the plaintiffs) must go to bed early or may stay up later.
You will produce a JSON array of individual “cases”.
Each case must conform to the JSON schema (which I will provide immediately after this prompt).

Scenario description:
1. Plaintiff = parents, who set the bedtime.
2. Defendant = child, who wants to stay up later.
3. A "win for plaintiff" (side = "plaintiff") means the child went to bed early.
4. A "win for plaintiff" (side = "defendant") means the child was allowed to stay up past the usual time.

Every case contains:
- A set of dimensional facts.
- A set of magnitudes used for the reason.
- A winning side.

Let us break these down. First, there are 5 dimensions which are present in every case.
Every dimension either strengthens the plaintiff or the defendant. If the dimension
strengthens the plaintiff, then the higher the value, the better for the plaintiff.
Conversely, if it strengthens the defendant, the higher the value, the better for the defendant.

The dimensions strengthening the plaintiff are:
1. "screen": The minutes of screen time the child had.
2. "protest": The level of protest by the child. It has exactly five values:
    (5) the child screamed and got physical
    (4) the child screamed
    (3) the child cried
    (2) the child complained but behaved
    (1) the child did not protest

The dimensions strengthening the defendant are:
3. "activity": The minutes of physical activity the child had.
4. "coop": The level of cooperation by the child with its sibling. It has exactly four values:
    (4) the child played and cooperated
    (3) the child ignored its sibling
    (2) the child got into a verbal fight
    (1) the child got into a physical fight
5. "read": The number of pages a child has read throughout the day.

In the set of facts, every dimension is assigned one of its allowed values.
In the set of magnitudes. A subset of these dimensions is used to specify which
facts influence the reason. It is important that the magnitude requires a fact
that is "at most as strong" for the winning side, as the fact present.
Note that you can and should use dimensions which strengthen the other side as magnitudes
as well. When a bigger value strengthens the plaintiff, a smaller value strengthens
the defendant and vice-verca. Therefore, all dimensions can be used for reasons.
Also try to generate the magnitudes such that they are usually weaker for the winning side
than the dimensional facts present. They can be equally strong or weaker, but not stronger!

To reiterate, because this is the hardest part to understand:
You need to generate the set of cases such that the reason values are sometimes weaker for the winning side.
This means that if a dimension strengthens the plaintiff and the winning side is the plaintiff,
the reason value needs to be smaller than or equal to the fact value.
If the dimension strengthens the defendant and the winning side is the plaintiff,
the reason value needs to be bigger than or equal to the fact value.
The converse applies to the defendant.

Please generate a case base of 20 cases according to the schema.
